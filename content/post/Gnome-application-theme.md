GTK+ â‰¥ 3.12 allows you to theme specific applications, such as nevolution.
<!--more-->

You can use the <kbd>GTK_THEME=[theme-name]  [application]</kbd> command to run a specific application with a specific theme. For example, you can enter <kbd>GTK_THEME=Yaru-dark evolution</kbd> in the terminal to run the evolution of the Yaru dark theme.

If you want to keep this theme permanently in a program,

You should go to <kbd>/usr/share/applications</kbd> and find and copy the application's .desktop file, in this case mine was org.gnome.Evolution.desktop. Then paste it into <kbd>~/.local/share/applications</kbd> and open it with a text editor,

Then after <kbd>=</kbd> add env <kbd>GTK_THEME=<theme-name></kbd> look for each line starting with <kbd>Exec=</kbd> and put a space after it so the rest of the line comes before it, eg: <kbd>Exec=env GTK_THEME= Yaru-Dark Evolution -c stream</kbd>

All done ðŸ˜„
